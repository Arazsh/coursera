You can achieve this by either filling it up with a lot of content text or simply setting its height property to something large like 700px. At the end of each section, provide a link that says "Back to Top". This link should jump the page back to "Our Menu" heading. (Hint: use a link that points to a section of the page discussed in Lecture 9 of Module 1.)The implementation of the page you will be creating should follow the mockup illustrations shown below. You are provided 3 mockups: desktop and tablet (same), mobile, and mobile with mobile menu dropdown shown. Your implementation has to be JUST 1 page.

It consists of a page heading and 3 sections (all in one row in the desktop view). Each section contains some text. You can make it dummy text/"lorem ipsum", it doesn't matter. How the sections are laid out on the screen depends on the width of the browser window.
